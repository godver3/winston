# Winston for Reddit

![Winston Logo](winston-everywhere/Resources/images/icon-128.png)

This is the official repository for Winston, a beautiful, FOSS, native handcrafted Reddit client for iOS.

This is a WIP, both the app and this README.

## Installing

Right now Winston's not on the App Store, so you have two options for using it:

1- You can join the TestFlight here (if it's not full or down because testflight recently has been failing pretty often):
https://testflight.apple.com/join/3UF8bAUN

or

2- Use [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) (or any other sideloading method) to sideload the IPA. You can download the IPA file [here on Github](https://github.com/Kinark/winston/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/winston.ipa).

We don't have a subreddit anymore because Reddit hates open source projects and the community as a whole and decided to ban all my accounts and each of the winston subreddits we created. There's always one or two inactive subs around, but I won't mention them here just for them to be banned.

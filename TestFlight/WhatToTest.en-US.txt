ðŸ†˜ REDDIT IS CHASING ME! PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU GOT TIME :(
Hello, I'm Igor, developer of Winston. Reddit recently banned my Reddit account u/Kinark, took r/winstonapp sub down and now my new account u/SusKinark was banned (and muted, so I can't ask why) from r/iphone for explaining to a random guy in a month old post what happened to my old account and the sub. That was my first interaction in the sub.

The consequence of that is that is that Winston is now free and open source forever, I'm counting with donations only. But as you have noticed, I lost my account, so I can't let people know about Winston in Reddit anymore (I never posted about it after it turned open source, for example), so if you'd like to help the project, spread the word! Let people know about Winston ðŸ˜º, that'll bring a bunch of people to our community and we'll be able to thrive together against Reddit bullship.


Thanks, that's it, sorry for using your time and super thank you for using Winston!

BIG UPDATE! So probably big bugs as well.
--------- IF YOU'RE HAVING CRASHES, TRY REINTALLING THE APP ---------
I've done too much and I'm exausted, so here's a short list of the zillion changes I made

- Early preview of iPad version (still buggy yet)
- Performance improvements, many of them (I hope so)
- Themes app integration improved
- Added change icon option
- Added chunk loading option
- Fixed many bugs, too many to count

And a zillion other things.

HUGE UPDATE! But I'm too tired to write a full changelog.

-----
IMPORTANT 1: THIS IS THE FIRST BUILD OF THE NEW THEMES SYSTEM. EXPECT BUGS/CRASHES AND PLEASE REPORT THEM IN THE DISCORD CHANNEL (if you feel like doing so)

- Themes: fantastic new option for you to customize everything in the app. It's a WIP, but it's already very good!
- Great performance improvements
- Crashes fixes
- Subreddits filter
- Many other stuff you may find around, good exploring.

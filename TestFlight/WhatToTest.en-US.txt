- Changed player, hopefully there will be way less crashes now
- Changed from "Defaults" to "CoreData" (something better) for storing multis and subbed subs, app should feel less laggy
- Fixed favorites not appearing right away
- Fixed links not appearing
- Fixed galleries not appearing
- Disabled autocorrection in search screen
- Fixed not subbed subs appearing
- Fixed alphabetical order everywhere

Some medias will still not appear, hoping to fix that in a few days.

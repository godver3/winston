PERFORMANCE (and a few options) UPDATE!

-- FUN CHANGELOG --
- The app should be way smoother now
- Fixed bug where multis weren't properly updated when changed
- Fixed tap area of post links
- Added option to mark post as read on media preview
- Added number transition to votes
- Dragging horizontally in videos won't close it anymore (it was messing with the progress bar sliding)
- Added setting to disable the alphabet letters in subs list for a simpler look
- Added clear preferences in General

-- BORING PERFORMANCE CHANGELOG --
- Now navigating between routes won't update any view other than root
- Youtube videos, links, internal links, none of that will reload every time it appears, they now have caches
- Now cache of the things mentioned in the previous point won't accumulate eternally and won't take your RAM usage to the sky (sorry about that)
- Now Markdown parsing if posts happens when fetching instead of when opening the post up
- Many things won't rerender for no reason anymore
- Replaced some shadows with a more performant version
- Caches updates won't reload all views related to the whole cache anymore
- Removed live text from videos that was cause a lot of lag and didn't work
- Much improved performance in subs with many videos
